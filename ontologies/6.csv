QuantitativeValue|Quantitative value A quantitative value is a numerical interval that represents the range of a certain gr:quantitativeProductOrServiceProperty in terms of the lower and upper bounds for a particular gr:ProductOrService. It is to be interpreted in combination with the respective unit of measurement. Most quantitative values are intervals even if they are in practice often treated as a single point value. Example: a weight between 10 and 25 kilogramms, a length between 10 and 15 milimeters. Compatibility with schema.org: This class is equivalent to http://schema.org/Quantity.
DayOfWeek|Day of week The day of the week, used to specify  to which day the opening hours of a gr:OpeningHoursSpecification refer. Examples: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,...
WarrantyScope|Warranty scope The warranty scope represents types of services that will be provided free of charge by the vendor or manufacturer in the case of a defect (e.g. labor and parts, just parts), as part of the warranty included in an gr:Offering. The actual services may be provided by the gr:BusinessEntity making the offering, by the manufacturer of the product, or by a third party. Examples: Parts and Labor, Parts PaymentChargeSpecification|Payment charge specification A payment charge specification is a conceptual entity that specifies the additional costs asked for settling the payment after accepting a given gr:Offering using a particular gr:PaymentMethod. A payment charge specification is characterized by (1) a monetary amount per order specified as a literal value of type float in combination with a Currency, (2) the payment method, and (3) a whether this charge includes local sales taxes, namely VAT. A gr:Offering may be linked to multiple payment charge specifications that specify alternative charges for various payment methods. Examples: Payment by VISA or Mastercard costs a fee of 3 Euros including VAT, payment by bank transfer in advance is free of charge.The total amount of this surcharge is specified as a float value of the gr:hasCurrencyValue property. The currency is specified via the gr:hasCurrency datatype property. Whether the price includes VAT or not is indicated by the gr:valueAddedTaxIncluded datatype property. The gr:PaymentMethod to which this charge applies is specified using the gr:appliesToPaymentMethod object property.  If the price can only be given as a range, use gr:hasMaxCurrencyValue and gr:hasMinCurrencyValue for the upper and lower bounds. Important: When querying for the price, always use gr:hasMaxCurrencyValue and gr:hasMinCurrencyValue. 
QualitativeValue|Qualitative value A qualitative value is a predefined value for a product characteristic. 
ProductOrServicesSomeInstancesPlaceholder|Product or services some instances placeholder (DEPRECATED) DEPRECATED - This class is superseded by gr:SomeItems. Replace all occurrences of gr:ProductOrServicesSomeInstancesPlaceholder by gr:SomeItems, if possible.
N-Ary-Relations|N-ary relations (DEPRECATED) This is the superclass for all classes that are placeholders for n-ary relations, which OWL cannot represent.
PriceSpecification|Price specification The superclass of all price specifications.
BusinessFunction|Business function The business function specifies the type of activity or access (i.e., the bundle of rights) offered by the gr:BusinessEntity on the gr:ProductOrService through the gr:Offering. Typical are sell, rental or lease, maintenance or repair, manufacture / produce, recycle / dispose, engineering / construction, or installation.
Brand|Brand A brand is the identity of a specific product, service, or business. Use foaf:logo for attaching a brand logo and gr:name or rdfs:label for attaching the brand name.	
Offer| 
PaymentMethod|Payment method A payment method is a standardized procedure for transferring the monetary amount for a purchase. Payment methods are characterized by the legal and technical structures used, and by the organization or group carrying out the transaction. This element is mostly used for specifying the types of payment accepted by a gr:BusinessEntity.
License|License A license is the specification of a bundle of rights that determines the type of activity or access offered by the gr:BusinessEntity on the gr:ProductOrService through the gr:Offering.
DeliveryMethod|Delivery method A delivery method is a standardized procedure for transferring the product or service to the destination of fulfilment chosen by the customer. Delivery methods are characterized by the means of transportation used, and by the organization or group that is the contracting party for the sending gr:BusinessEntity (this is important, since the contracted party may subcontract the fulfilment to smaller, regional businesses).
DeliveryModeParcelService|Delivery mode parcel service A private parcel service as the delivery mode available for a certain offering.
Person| 
OpeningHoursSpecification|Opening hours specification This is a conceptual entity that holds together all information about the opening hours on a given day (gr:DayOfWeek).
BusinessEntityType|Business entity type A business entity type is a conceptual entity representing the legal form, the size, the main line of business, the position in the value chain, or any combination thereof, of a gr:BusinessEntity. From the ontological point of view, business entity types are mostly roles that a business entity has in the market. Business entity types are important for specifying eligible customers, since a gr:Offering is often valid only for business entities of a certain size, legal structure, or role in the value chain. 
Individual|Individual A gr:Individual is an actual product or service instance, i.e., a single identifiable object or action that creates some increase in utility (in the economic sense) for the individual possessing or using this very object (product) or for the individual in whose favor this very action is being taken (service). Products or services are types of goods in the economic sense. For an overview of goods and commodities in economics, see Milgate (1987).
SomeItems|Some items A placeholder instance for unknown instances of a mass-produced commodity. This is used as a computationally cheap work-around for such instances that are not individually exposed on the Web but just stated to exist (i.e., which are existentially quantified).
Organization| 
Place| 
Location|Location A location is a point or area of interest from which a particular product or service is available, e.g. a store, a bus stop, a gas station, or a ticket booth. The difference to gr:BusinessEntity is that the gr:BusinessEntity is the legal entity (e.g. a person or corporation) making the offer, while gr:Location is the store, office, or place. A chain restaurant will e.g. have one legal entity but multiple restaurant locations. Locations are characterized by an address or geographical position and a set of opening hour specifications for various days of the week.
ProductOrServiceModel|Product or service model A product or service model is a intangible entity that specifies some characteristics of a group of similar, usually mass-produced products, in the sense of a prototype. In case of mass-produced products, there exists a relation gr:hasMakeAndModel between the actual product or service (gr:Individual or gr:SomeItems) and the prototype (gr:ProductOrServiceModel). GoodRelations treats product or service models as "prototypes" instead of a completely separate kind of entities, because this allows using the same domain-specific properties (e.g. gr:weight) for describing makes and models and for describing actual products.
TypeAndQuantityNode|Type and quantity node This class collates all the information about a gr:ProductOrService included in a bundle. If a gr:Offering contains just one item, you can directly link from the gr:Offering to the gr:ProductOrService using gr:includes. If the offering contains multiple items, use an instance of this class for each component to indicate the quantity, unit of measurement, and type of product, and link from the gr:Offering via gr:includesObject.
LocationOfSalesOrServiceProvisioning|Location of sales or service provisioning (DEPRECATED) DEPRECATED - This class is superseded by gr:Location. Replace all occurrences of gr:LocationOfSalesOrServiceProvisioning by gr:Location, if possible.
QuantitativeValueFloat|Quantitative value float An instance of this class is an actual float value for a quantitative property of a product. This instance is usually characterized by a minimal value, a maximal value, and a unit of measurement.
BusinessEntity|Business entity An instance of this class represents the legal agent making (or seeking) a particular offering. This can be a legal body or a person. A business entity has at least a primary mailing address and contact details. For this, typical address standards (vCard) and location data (geo, WGS84) can be attached. Note that the location of the business entity is not necessarily the location from which the product or service is being available (e.g. the branch or store). Use gr:Location for stores and branches.
PaymentMethodCreditCard|Payment method credit card The subclass of gr:PaymentMethod represents all variants and brands of credit or debit cards as a standardized procedure for transferring the monetary amount for a purchase. It is mostly used for specifying the types of payment accepted by a gr:Business Entity.
Offering|Offering An offering represents the public, not necessarily binding, not necessarily exclusive, announcement by a gr:BusinessEntity to provide (or seek) a certain gr:BusinessFunction for a certain gr:ProductOrService to a specified target audience. An offering is specified by the type of product or service or bundle it refers to, what business function is being offered (sales, rental, ...), and a set of commercial properties. It can either refer to 
ProductOrService|Product or service The superclass of all classes describing products or services types, either by nature or purpose. Examples for such subclasses are "TV set", "vacuum cleaner", etc. An instance of this class can be either an actual product or service (gr:Individual), a placeholder instance for unknown instances of a mass-produced commodity (gr:SomeItems), or a model / prototype specification (gr:ProductOrServiceModel). When in doubt, use gr:SomeItems.
ActualProductOrServiceInstance|Actual product or service instance (DEPRECATED) DEPRECATED - This class is superseded by gr:Individual. Replace all occurrences of gr:ActualProductOrServiceInstance by gr:Individual, if possible.
QuantitativeValueInteger|Quantitative value integer An instance of this class is an actual integer value for a quantitative property of a product. This instance is usually characterized by a minimal value, a maximal value, and a unit of measurement. 
hasValueFloat|has value float (0..1) This subproperty specifies that the upper and lower limit of the given gr:QuantitativeValueFloat are identical and have the respective float value. It is a shortcut for such cases where a quantitative property is (at least practically) a single point value and not an interval.
