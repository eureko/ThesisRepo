# Foodon  is a new ontology built to interoperate with the OBO Library and to represent entities which bear a “food role”.  It encompasses materials in natural ecosystems and food webs as well as human- centric categorization and handling of food. The latter will be the initial focus of the ontology, and we aim to develop semantics for food safety, food security, the agricultural and animal husbandry practices linked to food production, culinary, nutritional and chemical ingredients and processes.
