#BBC Food Ontology by BBC. The Food Ontology is a simple lightweight ontology for publishing data about recipes, including the foods they are made from and the foods they create as well as the diets, menus, seasons, courses and occasions they may be suitable for. Whilst it originates in a specific BBC use case, the Food Ontology should be applicable to a wide range of recipe data publishing across the web.
