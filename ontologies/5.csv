#LIRMM Food Ontology by LIRMM Laboratoire: This ontology models the Food domain. It allows to describe ingredients and food products. Some classes are: food:Recipe, food:Food, food:FoodProduct, food:Dish, food:Ingredient, etc.
FoodProduct|A manufactured food product null
Dish|A dish is a food item with a recipe null
Recipe|Recipe A recipe as a set of ingredients together with the protocol to prepare the resulting food
Food|Anything that can be eaten: a basic Food item (e.g. salt), a Dish made with a recipe, a manufactured Food Product null
Ingredient|An ingredient : a certain quantity of food that is part of another food Represents an ingredient line in a recipe (for a Dish) or an ingredient listed in the ingredient list (for a Product).We need to specify a quantity and unit, so the relation is not binary. So the value for the containsIngredient property of a Food object is an object of the IngredientAmount class (instead of a Food object or string directly). See http://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-n-aryRelations/ for details.
